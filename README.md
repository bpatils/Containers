# Containers

Container is a standard unit of software that functions like a fully provisioned machine that has all the necessary software installed on it to run an appication. It basically is a way of packaging software so that application and their dependencies have a self-contained environment to run in, and is insulated from the host OS and other applications. They can be easily ported to other environments.

Images define what goes into a container. Containers are running instances of Images(i.e containers are built from Images).
